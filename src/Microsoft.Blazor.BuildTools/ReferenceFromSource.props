  Importing this file is equivalent to having:
    <PackageDependency Include="Microsoft.Blazor.BuildTools" />
  ... except it's much more convenient when working in this repo, because it consumes the
  BuildTools targets/exe directly without needing BuildTools to be packed into a .nupkg.
  
  This is only intended for use by other projects in this repo.

  <Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)targets\All.targets" />

  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- Ensures BuildTools itself is built before the consuming project, but without
         adding a runtime dependency on the .dll (to be equivalent to a <PackageDependency>
         given that the packed version of BuildTools wouldn't add a .dll reference) -->
